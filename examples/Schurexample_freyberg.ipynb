    "This example is based on the synthetic classroom model of Freyberg(1988).  The  model is a 2-dimensional MODFLOW model with 1 layer,  40 rows, and 20 columns.  The model has 2 stress periods: an initial steady-state stress period used for calibration, and a 5-year transient stress period.  The calibration period uses the recharge and well flux of Freyberg(1988); the last stress period use 25% less recharge and 25% more pumping to represent future conditions for a forecast period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse problem has 761 parameters: hydraulic conductivity of each active model cell, calibration and forecast period recharge multipliers, storage and specific yield, calibration and forecast well flux for each of the six wells, and river bed conductance for each 40 cells with river-type boundary conditions.  The inverse problem has 12 head obseravtions, measured at the end of the steady-state calibration period.  The forecasts of interest include the sw-gw exchange flux during both stress periods (observations named ```sw_gw_0``` and ``sw_gw_1``), and the water level in well cell 6 located in at row 28 column 5 at the end of the stress periods (observations named ```or28c05_0``` and ```or28c05_1```).  The forecasts are included in the Jacobian matrix as zero-weight observations. The model files, pest control file and previously-calculated jacobian matrix are in the `freyberg/` folder\n",

With specific forecasts of interest, we can evaluate which information contributes most to forecast uncertainty. This is accomplished by assuming a parameter (or group of parameters) is perfectly known and assessing the forecast uncertainty under that assumption. Of course, this is a pretty serious approximation because perfect knowledge of a parameter can never be obtained in reality. In fact, it is difficult to calculate what, for example, a pumping test will provide in terms of uncertainty reduction for a parameter. Nonetheless, this metric can still provide important insights into model dynamics and help guide future data collection efforts.\n",

For both forecasts originating from the second model stress period (the \"forecast\" period), the forecast-period forcings (which represent future recharge and future water use) play a role in reducing forecast uncertainty for the forecast period. Calibration forcings (current recharge and water use) are important for the calibration-period `sw_gw` exchange forecast (``sw_gw_0``), but are dwarfed by properties for the calibration-period head forecast (``or28c05_0``). Properties are important across the board, but in both cases their importance is reduced in the forecast period due to the increasing importance of forcing.\n",

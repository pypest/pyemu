    "Here is an example based on the model of Freyberg, 1988.  The synthetic model is a 2-dimensional MODFLOW model with 1 layer,  40 rows, and 20 columns.  The model has 2 stress periods: an initial steady-state stress period used for calibration, and a 5-year transient stress period.  The calibration period uses the recharge and well flux of Freyberg, 1988; the last stress period use 25% less recharge and 25% more pumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse problem has 761 parameters: hydraulic conductivity of each active model cell, calibration and forecast period recharge multipliers, storage and specific yield, calibration and forecast well flux for each of the six wells, and river bed conductance for each 40 cells with river-type boundary conditions.  The inverse problem has 12 head obseravtions, measured at the end of the steady-state calibration period.  The forecasts of interest include the sw-gw exchange flux during both stress periods (observations named ```sw_gw_0``` and ``sw_gw_1``), and the water level in well cell 6 located in at row 28 column 5 at the end of the stress periods (observations named ```or28c05_0``` and ```or28c05_1```).  The forecasts are included in the Jacobian matrix as zero-weight observations. The model files, pest control file and previously-calculated jacobian matrix are in the `freyberg/` folder\n",
